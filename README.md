# Today I Learned

Everyday life, the knowledge bypass my brain and go thru. I used to note them to Notes.app or Evernote before. Later I found that very frustrating and I even did not open them again. As a CTO & Tech Entrepreneur, Github is one of the most opened site of mine. Lots of ideas can be found on Github, not just engineering stuffs, so I decided to note them all here.

These are what I've learned everyday, organized by Github Issue. If you are interested in this idea, please follow #til and support us.
